# Python-Course-Final-Project-Blackjack
This is a blackjack game i created for a school project

The project has no extra packages. 
To start the project, clone this repository and write python.game.py to initiate the main class.

There was a requirement that the player should chose to be either a dealer or a player. 
I did not implement that, because the dealer's actions are set in stone and it won't be fun for the player.
Instead i have added a choice of how many decks would the player want in the game and tips from ["Basic Strategy"](https://www.gamblingpedia.org/blackjack-strategy/).
